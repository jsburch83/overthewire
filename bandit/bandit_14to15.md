1. Connect via ssh:

    `ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i <ident file location>`

2. Using the ssh key you got from the last level login to the level14. 

3. After looking at the instructions I didn't understand what they meant by submit the current level password. I then noticed the hint commands contained telnet. 

I went for this command: 

4. `telnet 127.0.0.1 30000`
