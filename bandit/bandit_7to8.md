1. Connect via ssh: 

	`ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
    The password is: HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs

2. I read in the data.txt file in my home directly and notice the terminal scrolling with lines of data.

3. I need to find the word **millionth** and get the password from that line. I already know the first thing Iâ€™m going to try is the grep command.
